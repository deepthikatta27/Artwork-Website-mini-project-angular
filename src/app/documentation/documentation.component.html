             and removing items from the wishlist.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Browsing Artwork Items</h4>
        <p>To browse artwork items, simply browse the home page where all available artworks are displayed.
            To filter the artwork list based on item name and its details, use the search bar in the navigation bar.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Adding Items to the Wishlist</h4>
        <p>To add an artwork item to the wishlist, simply click the "heart" icon on top-right of item image you want to add.
             The item will be added to the wishlist, which you can view on the "Wishlist" page of the
             application and a alert will be displayed indicating that the item is added in the wishlist.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Removing Items from the Wishlist</h4>
        <p>To remove an artwork item from the wishlist, simply click on the "heart" icon on the image again or navigate to the "Wishlist"
             section of the application and click the "Remove" button
            next to the item you want to remove. The item will be removed from the wishlist, alert message will be displayed and
